        <div id="carl-letter">
          <p>Dear Neil</p>
          <p>
            Thanks for your letter and most interesting resume. I was especially
            glad to see that, for a career in astronomy, you intend to do your
            undergraduate work in physics. In this way, you will acquire the
            essential tools for a wide range of subsequent astronomical
            endeavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would guess from your resume that your interests in astronomy are
            sufficiently deep and your mathematical and physical background
            sufficiently strong that we could probably engage you in real
            astronomical research during your undergraduate career here, if the
            possibility interests you. For example, we hope to be bringing back
            to Ithaca in late calendar year 1976 an enormous array of Viking
            data on Mars both from the orbiters and from the landers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would be delighted to meet with you when you visit Ithaca. Please
            try and give as much advance notice of the date as you can because
            my travel schedule is quite hectic right now and I really would like
            to be in Ithaca when you drop by.
          </p>
          <p>With all good wishes,</p>
          <p>Carl Sagan</p>

          <p>Dear Prof. Sagan</p>
          <p>
            Thank you for your offer concerning the Viking Missions. After long
            thought and decision making I have chosen to attend Harvard
            University this September. I chose it not simply because of its
            “valuable” name but because they have a larger astronomy department
            in addition to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, so while I
            am majoring in physics I will have more surrounding me in the way of
            on-going research in astronomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to say that I did enjoy meeting you and I am very grateful
            for your hospitality and the time you spent with me while at
            Cornell. I will throughout my undergraduate years keep you informed
            on any noteworthy news concerning astronomy-related work that I’m
            involved in. I do plan to apply again for the Viking Internship next
            summer.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks again</p>
          <p>Neil D. Tyson</p>
